# Push-button-and-forward-kinematic
In this work, I made a control for the push-button, assuming that the LED and the lamp are the human robot to show us its state, whether it started or stopped. I did that in two ways, the first through the relay and the transistor as requested, and also in a second way, I assumed the presence of a sensor in the event that anyone around the robot It works and in the event that no one is present, the robot automatically closes, and we also control it through the push-button...and I also worked on the forward kinematic and finding the end of effect point of the robot arm
